# Codeclause (BOTH PROJECTS DESCRIPTION IS AS FOLLOWS)
# project 1 (Churn Prediction in Telecom Industry using Logistic Regression):-
The goal of this project is to predict customer churn in the telecom industry using logistic regression. Churn refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue their subscription or service with a particular company. Identifying and predicting customer churn is crucial for telecom companies as it helps them retain customers and develop strategies to reduce churn rate.

In this project, we will utilize a dataset that contains historical customer information, including demographics, usage patterns, and churn status. By applying logistic regression, a widely used classification algorithm, we aim to build a predictive model that can effectively identify customers who are likely to churn.

The project involves the following steps:

Data Exploration and Preprocessing: We will start by exploring the dataset, understanding the features, and performing necessary data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numeric features.

Feature Selection and Engineering: We will analyze the dataset to identify relevant features that are indicative of customer churn. This may involve feature selection techniques, such as correlation analysis or recursive feature elimination. Additionally, we may create new features by combining or transforming existing ones to improve the predictive power of the model.

Model Training: The next step is to train a logistic regression model on the preprocessed data. We will split the dataset into training and testing sets, fit the logistic regression model on the training set, and evaluate its performance using appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

Model Evaluation and Optimization: We will assess the performance of the logistic regression model and fine-tune its hyperparameters to optimize its predictive ability. Techniques such as cross-validation, grid search, or random search can be employed to find the best hyperparameter configuration.

Interpretation and Insights: Once we have a trained and optimized model, we can interpret the coefficients to understand the impact of different features on the likelihood of churn. This can provide valuable insights to the telecom company, enabling them to take proactive measures to retain customers.

Deployment and Future Work: Finally, we can deploy the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data. We can also explore additional techniques or models to further enhance churn prediction accuracy, such as ensemble methods or other classification algorithms.

By successfully completing this project, we can provide the telecom company with a reliable churn prediction model that can help them identify customers at risk of churn. This, in turn, allows the company to take proactive actions, such as targeted marketing campaigns or personalized retention offers, to mitigate churn and improve customer retention.

# Market Basket Analysis in Python using Apriori Algorithm
Apriori Algorithm
The algorithm was first proposed in 1994 by Rakesh Agrawal and Ramakrishnan Srikant. Apriori algorithm finds the most frequent itemsets or elements in a transaction database and identifies association rules between the items just like the above-mentioned example.

How Apriori works ?
To construct association rules between elements or items, the algorithm considers 3 important factors which are, support, confidence and lift. Each of these factors is explained as follows:

Support:

The support of item I is defined as the ratio between the number of transactions containing the item I by the total number of transactions 

Support indicates how popular an itemset is, as measured by the proportion of transactions in which an itemset appears. In Table 1 below, the support of {apple} is 4 out of 8, or 50%. Itemsets can also contain multiple items. For instance, the support of {apple, beer, rice} is 2 out of 8, or 25%.

If you discover that sales of items beyond a certain proportion tend to have a significant impact on your profits, you might consider using that proportion as your support threshold. You may then identify itemsets with support values above this threshold as significant itemsets.

Confidence:

This is measured by the proportion of transactions with item I1, in which item I2 also appears. The confidence between two items I1 and I2, in a transaction is defined as the total number of transactions containing both items I1 and I2 divided by the total number of transactions containing I1. ( Assume I1 as X , I2 as Y )

Confidence says how likely item Y is purchased when item X is purchased, expressed as {X -> Y}. This is measured by the proportion of transactions with item X, in which item Y also appears., the confidence of {apple -> beer} is 3 out of 4, or 75%.

One drawback of the confidence measure is that it might misrepresent the importance of an association. This is because it only accounts for how popular apples are, but not beers. If beers are also very popular in general, there will be a higher chance that a transaction containing apples will also contain beers, thus inflating the confidence measure. To account for the base popularity of both constituent items, we use a third measure called lift.

Lift:

Lift is the ratio between the confidence and support.

Lift says how likely item Y is purchased when item X is purchased, while controlling for how popular item Y is. In Table 1, the lift of {apple -> beer} is 1,which implies no association between items. A lift value greater than 1 means that item Y is likely to be bought if item X is bought, while a value less than 1 means that item Y is unlikely to be bought if item X is bought. ( here X represents apple and Y represents beer )
